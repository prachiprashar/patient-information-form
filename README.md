## üìÇ Data Handling & Submission

This project is a **frontend-only application** designed to demonstrate UI/UX and client-side logic.

### 1. How Data is Handled

Upon clicking the "Submit" button, the application performs the following actions:
1.  Validates all form fields to ensure the data is complete and correct.
2.  Collects all the data into a single JavaScript object.
3.  **Logs this object to the browser's developer console.**

### 2. Viewing the Output

To see the captured data:
1.  Run the project locally (see instructions below).
2.  Open your browser's Developer Tools (usually by pressing `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`).
3.  Click on the **"Console"** tab.
4.  Fill out the form and click "Submit".
5.  The complete form data object will appear in the console.

> **Note on Production Use:** This console-logging approach is for demonstration purposes only. A production-ready application would send this data via a secure API request to a backend server for storage in a database.
